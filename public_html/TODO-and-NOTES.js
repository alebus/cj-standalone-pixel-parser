*I moved notes and GENERAL TODO into here on 05-07-2015
*
*
*PUSHING TEST VERSIONS:
*I created a separate dir on Shell 1
*just SFTP whatever you want into there, ensure you have the correct dir
*HAVE PEOPLE USE THAT before you push that version live
*change the version number when you push and make a note in here
*
***PUT NEW FEATURES IN WEEKLY
*
*Version: 1.2: major updates to HTML and output format, plus a move to shell1 from allied
*Version: 1.3: move into netbeans, move to github, etc etc
*05-05-2015 I removed popup which included changing the CSS
*version 1.4: 05-05-2015 and 05-06-2015: tons of changes to add various error checking, etc etc etc
*also supports encoded ampersands now, changed for loop structure, etc etc
*
*TODO how best keep track of version numbers? or don't?
*
*
*TODO do you need to escape input etc? esp if something located on external server, I don't want them doing XSS attacks etc
*JS/jQuery book has some great info on that 
*
**TODO you could have it display every param that is NOT in a list of known params
*
*TODO see notes in Onenote
*
*
*TODO update to match kibana version as needed but remember that a lot of this works differently 
*
*TODO verify that subtotal is a number and say something if it is not
*
*TODO do the same checks for DCNT and DISCOUNT that you are doing for AMT/AMOUNT
*should probably do it as a function since it's basically the same code 4 times
*
